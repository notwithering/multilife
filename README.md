# multilife

a program to place multiple conway's-game-of-life-like cellular automata in a single ecosystem that can all interact with eachother

change the species you want to spawn in specie.go and other stuff in other files like ecosystem size in ecosystem.go and video fps in video.go and seed in rng.go and stuff

run the program and it outputs `output.mp4` file with the video replay of the simulation
